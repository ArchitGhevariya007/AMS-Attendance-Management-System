Developer's  Note :
           all the github users and software developers who might be interested in AMS software design and development we heartly welcome you on this opensource
project and software.

           both the "GUI and CONSOLE" folder has containing source codes accordingly but kindly keep in mind that files might be not working as expected because we have removed some part of code  in file as it is containing "confidential information" about AMS software and It may break down "Security" of AMS software and Affect the "overall perfomence" of AMS software

e.g. passwords, database path , mastercode keys, and some extremely highly confidential content of code
 
Don't worry you can still modify the code for your personal use and make it fully working
but for that you need to change some information in  source code accordingly

==> HOW TO RECOGNISE THAT CHANGEABLE PART :  

==> Things written in snake_case
_variables__string__are_written_like__this 
_parameters__are_written_like__this 
_other_things_

you can change those details accordingly and make it work
you can add fetures and solve bugs in application
and make pull request to this repository we will review it

Rest of the source code is open source.

Thank you for taking interst in AMS software.
